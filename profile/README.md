## What is Drone Hack?

**Drone Hack** is an ethical research and training platform focused on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) security.  
Designed for security researchers, engineers, and educators, it enables safe simulation of attack-defense scenarios, resilience testing, and operator training — all within isolated testbeds and virtual environments.

**Legal notice:** Drone Hack is intended solely for lawful, ethical use: research, education and defensive testing with proper authorization. It does not provide methods for illegal interference with third-party UAVs.

## Key Capabilities (non-actionable)

- Simulation of control and telemetry protocols in sandboxed environments.  
- Network condition emulation (latency, jitter, packet loss) to evaluate robustness.  
- Advanced logging, event correlation and incident reporting for security assessments.  
- Laboratory scenarios for red/blue team exercises under controlled rules of engagement.  
- Training modules covering radio fundamentals, telemetry security, encryption basics and incident response.  
- Report generation with prioritized recommendations for mitigation and hardening.  
- API hooks for integration with flight simulators, GIS and monitoring systems (no live-device control by default).

## Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ethical focus | Emphasizes defensive research and lawful testing |
| Academia ready | Suitable for classroom labs and research projects |
| Integration friendly | API for simulators and monitoring tools |
| Actionable reports | Produces non-sensitive, remediation-oriented findings |
| Local-first design | Logs and data retained on-premises by default |

---

## Use Cases

- Security research on UAV communication and resilience.  
- University labs teaching UAV cybersecurity and incident response.  
- Development teams validating firmware and telemetry encryption in testbeds.  
- Operators rehearsing detection and mitigation procedures in simulated incidents.  
- Consultants producing security assessments and hardening plans.
